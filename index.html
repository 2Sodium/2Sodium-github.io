					This whole page is a stupid project idea from a random youtube video. There isnt much to type and I don't even have an aim for this webpage.
					I am just typing this stuff out because my reference page has a whole lot a paragraph in it in the side so i just wanna replicate that stuff 
					here in my page. The whole page is made of html and css and blah blah blah you get the gist of it. This is just my baby step get to know 
					more about how http and https work and how basically the internet work and also how to use the git which i have only used to download cool 
					.dotfiles or programs for my daily day to day use. This was supposed to have an image of mine in the left and i even coded it to have all that 
					space but when it came time to put it in the .html file i realised i am not much comfortable in putting face in any of social platform.
					(A late and stupid time to realise... I know). But just making this stupily simple webpage itself was fun. I am hoping for anyone to see this
					but if you have found it in the internet then either my system got hacked or i grew a pair and learned some stuff !! Byee !!
